## WHEN TO USE CONSTRUCTOR PATTERN
EXAMPLE :
- QUESTIONS/CREATING USERS

-  INHERITANCE PATTERN / METHODS WHICH PRE_HARDCODED AS VALUES WE CREATED INITIALLY

## Prototype Pattern
EXAMPLE :
*DNA IS GOOD EXAMPLE
- CONSTRUCTOR : EYES,HAIR 
- PROTOTYPE  :DNA

##  WHEN TO USE MODULAR PATTERN
EXAMPLE :
*Chef want to cook ,  he maintains different fridge:
- 1. meat fridge
- 2. vegs fridge

=> uses its according whens its needed

```bash
   - ADVANTAGES
 * 1. MAINTAINABILITY (avoid DRY)
 * 2. NAMESPACING ( Global variables(BAD PRACTISE), namespace pollution)
 * 3. REUSABILITY ( reuse code in different projects)
```

## WHEN TO USE CONSTRUCTOR PATTERN
EXAMPLE :
- Questions
-  Creating Users

-  INHERITANCE PATTERN / METHODS WHICH PRE_HARDCODED AS VALUES WE CREATED INITIALLY

## Prototype Pattern
EXAMPLE :
*DNA IS GOOD EXAMPLE
- CONSTRUCTOR : EYES,HAIR 
- PROTOTYPE  :DNA

##  WHEN TO USE MODULAR PATTERN
EXAMPLE :
*Chef want to cook ,  he maintains different fridge:
- 1. meat fridge
- 2. vegs fridge

=> uses its according whens its needed

```bash
   - ADVANTAGES
 * 1. MAINTAINABILITY (avoid DRY)
 * 2. NAMESPACING ( Global variables(BAD PRACTISE), namespace pollution)
 * 3. REUSABILITY ( reuse code in different projects)
```

##  Factory Pattern
EXAMPLE : Factory produces many products(car,motor,buses)
 * Factory may have sub factories
 * End user doesn't care about production process
 * He cares only how to sale a product

=> uses its according whens its needed

```bash
 * Advantages
 * 1. To seprate the object creation from its implementation
 * 2. To create a different instance based on conditions
 * 3 .Not exposes the constructors of the objects, preventing their modifications
```


##  Singleton Pattern

 * Singleton pattern doesn't allow you to create new instance every time, instead using reference it server the needs

 * Example: Buying a Course once, if you try to buy its doesn't allow you.


=> uses its according whens its needed

```bash
 * Hardware access
 * Database connections
 * Config files 
 * sharing a single washing machine among all the residents in a hotel
```


##  Builder Pattern / COMPOSITION
 * Suppose a customize computer then we should this patter
 * assume that we have boxes and its has label on it to differentiate,
 * so we can get any detail easily

```bash
 * To simplify the constructor of a complex object
 * To sepate the constructor and representation
 * COMPOSITION
 * Different representation for the object that is constructed 
 * 
 * ISSUES : To know what exactly this parameters are?
 * we can only say if we see the Person implementation
 *                              ?     ?    ?    ? 
 * const person = new Person('nick',true,false,true)
 * 
 * fix around 
 * const person = new Person('nick').employee().manager().partTime(12)
```


##  Decorator Pattern (Mechanic)
  -  Add additional feature to existing objects

```bash
 * 
 * 1. Modify an object dynamically
 * 2. Uses composition instead of inheritance
 * 3. More flexibility than static inheritance
```


```bash
 * //Example game 
 * const car = new Car('BMW')
 * const superCar = new CarTunning(car) // Updated 
 * 
```
